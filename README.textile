h1. Camel component for Beanstalk

"Beanstalk":http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/ is a simple work queue service.

"Apache Camel":http://camel.apache.org/ is an integration framework.

@camel-beanstalk@ project provides a Camel component for job retrieval and post-processing of Beanstalk jobs.

Please see the detailed explanation of Beanstalk job lifecycle at "Beanstalk protocol":http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt

h2. Example

This Camel component lets you both request the jobs for processing and supply them to Beanstald daemon. Our simple demo routes may look like

bc. from("beanstalk:testTube").
   log("Processing job #${in.header.beanstalk.jobId} with body ${in.body}").
   process(new Processor() {
     @override public void process(Exchange exchange) {
       // try to make integer value out of body
       exchange.getIn().setBody( Integer.valueOf(exchange.getIn().getBody(classOf[String])) );
     }
   }).
   log("Parsed job #${in.header.camel.beanstalk.jobId} to body ${in.body}");

bc. from("timer:dig?period=30seconds").
   setBody(constant(10)).log("Kick ${in.body} buried/delayed tasks").
   to("beanstalk:testTube?command=kick");

In the first route we are listening for new jobs in tube "testTube". When they are arriving, we are trying to parse integer value from the message body. If done successful, we log it and this successful exchange completion makes Camel component to _delete_ this job from Beanstalk automatically. Contrary, when we cannot parse the job data, the exchange failes and the Camel component _buries_ it by default, so that it can be processed later or probably we are going to inspect failed jobs manually.

So the second route periodically requests Beanstalk to _kick_ 10 jobs out of buried and/or delayed state to the normal queue.

h2. Component URI format

The component URI is

bc. beanstalk://[host[:port]][/tube]?query

You may omit either @port@ or both @host@ and @port@: for the Beanstalk defaults to be used ("localhost" and 11300). If you omit @tube@, Beanstalk component will use the tube with name "default".

When listening, you may probably want to watch for jobs from several tubes. Just separate them with plus sign, e.g.

bc. beanstalk://localhost:11300/tube1+tube2

Tube name will be URL decoded, so if your tube names include special characters like + or ?, you need to URL-encode them appropriately.

By the way, you cannot specify several tubes when you are writing jobs into Beanstalk.

h3. Parameters

Common parameters are listed below along with the message header names. Message header always takes the highest precedence over the URI.

|_. Parameter|_. Header|_. Unit|_. Default|
|@jobPriority@|_beanstalk.priority_|integer|0 (actually the highest, see "Beanstalk protocol":http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt)|
|@jobDelay@|_beanstalk.delay_|seconds|0|
|@jobTimeToRun@|_beanstalk.timeToRun_|seconds|0 (and the beanstalkd daemon raises it to 1 automatically, see "Beanstalk protocol":http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt)|

h3. Producer parameters

Producer behaviour is affected by the @command@ parameter which tells what to do with the job, it can be

* @put@ means to put the job into Beanstalk. Job body is specified in the Camel message body. Job ID will be returned in _beanstalk.jobId_ message header.
* @delete@, @release@, @touch@ or @bury@ expect Job ID in the message header _beanstalk.jobId_. Result of the operation is returned in _beanstalk.result_ message header
* @kick@ expects the number of jobs to kick in the message body and returns the number of jobs actually kicked out in the message header _beanstalk.result_.

h3. Consumer parameters

By default the consumer calls @delete@ on successful job completion and calls @bury@ on failure. You can choose which command to execute in the case of failure by specifying @onFailure@ parameter in the URI. It can take values of @bury@, @delete@ or @release@.

Be careful when specifying @release@, as the failed job will immediately become available in the same tube and your consumer will try to acquire it again. You can @release@ and specify _jobDelay_ though.
